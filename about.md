GRIMbot is an ElThree AI Original Product.

#### -About GRIMbot-

GRIMbot is an application designed to allow users to quickly calculate the most efficient battle outcomes for their favorite tabletop battle games. Specifically, GRIMbot allows warriors of the far future calculate the probability that their attack will be successful. This includes the ability to designate thresholds to hit, wound and save an attack. By adjusting these parameters, users can tailor their Order of Battle to compare battle scenarios and maximize their output. Additionally, you can calculate the Damage Efficiency for a given weapon or unit. Do your deadly snipers or vicious bezerkers score extra attacks on critical hits? No problem, GRIMbot has you covered. Our goal is to help you optimize your lists for maximum competativeness!

#### -How to use GRIMbot-

##### Hitting a Target

To successfully utlize GRIMbot, you'll first need to ensure that you have your thresholds for rolling mapped out. Your unit or weapon should have a specific rolling threshold for hitting a target, you'll want to adjust this by clicking the "+" button in the box beneath "Hit Target".

###### Exploding 6's

If your unit or weapon is savage enough to score bonus hits on the roll of a six, be sure to check the "Exploding Sixes" box to incorporate this into your calculation. Additionally, by clicking the "Exploding Sixes" box you will enable the even more ferocious "Double Exploding Sixes" box to be marked as well. Similarly, clicking both of these will allow for you to calculate your success probability for rolls which "explode" twice, or add two additional hits per roll, on a single roll of a six.

##### Wounding a Target

Next, you will have to identify your wounding threshold. Don't forget to add any multipliers or other augmentations. Once you have a threshold identified adjusted to, you'll want to adjust this by clicking the "+" button in the box beneath "Wound Target".

##### Saves


You should have an armour threshold identified for preventing damage, you'll want to adjust this by clicking the "â–¼" dropdown button in the box beneath "Save Type".

##### Armour Penetration

Looking at your units weapon profile you'll need to account for the armour penetration. This directly impacts the saving throw needed by the defending target to prevent wounds from causing damage. For example, if you have a 3+ armour save, and an armour penetration of 2, the new armous save is now 5+ for your target. Once you have a value identified to change to, you'll want to adjust this by clicking the "+" button in the box beneath "AP Mod".

##### Broken Armour

If your Armour Penetration is strong enough to over power your targets save (if it exceeds a dice roll of six), then the "Armour Broken" Message will appear indicating that no save throw is being enabled. In terms of the calculation this will allow wounds to cut right through as damage.

##### Damage

Each weapon or unit should have a specific amount of damage it can inflict.  Once you have a value identified to change to, you'll want to adjust this by clicking the "+" button in the box beneath "Weapon Dmg."

#### -Features-

##### Dice Sides

The number of available sides per a single roll can be adjusted. Keep in mind this is reflected across all rolls and should be rarely used.

##### Number of Dice

If you'd like to augment the number of dice you are rolling, perhaps based on the number of attacks your weapon or unit offers, you can adjust this by sliding the number bar (left to right) under "Number of Dice for Hit Roll" to increase or decrease the number of dice being rolled given the values in the parameter boxes.

##### Damage Efficiency

By selecting the Damage Efficieny box you will be enabled to enter in a point value for your weapon or unit. By doing this you will be enabled to see the damage given per point spent on the unit or weapon.
